Pandas Homework - Pandas, Pandas, Pandas

Background
The data dive continues!
Now, it's time to take what you've learned about Python Pandas and apply it to new situations. For this assignment, you'll need to complete Heroes of Pymoli Data Challenges. 

Before You Begin


Create a new repository for this project called pandas-challenge. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.


Clone the new repository to your computer.


Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the Pandas Challenge you choose. Name the folder HeroesOfPymoli


Add your Jupyter notebook to this folder. This will be the main script to run for analysis.


Push the above changes to GitHub or GitLab.



Heroes of Pymoli

Congratulations! After a lot of hard work in the data munging mines, you've landed a job as Lead Analyst for an independent gaming company. You've been assigned the task of analyzing the data for their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.
Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, the company would like you to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.
Your final report should include each of the following:

Player Count

Total Number of Players


Purchasing Analysis (Total)

Number of Unique Items
Average Purchase Price
Total Number of Purchases
Total Revenue


Gender Demographics

Percentage and Count of Male Players
Percentage and Count of Female Players
Percentage and Count of Other / Non-Disclosed


Purchasing Analysis (Gender)

The below each broken by gender

Purchase Count
Average Purchase Price
Total Purchase Value
Average Purchase Total per Person by Gender




Age Demographics

The below each broken into bins of 4 years (i.e. <10, 10-14, 15-19, etc.)

Purchase Count
Average Purchase Price
Total Purchase Value
Average Purchase Total per Person by Age Group




Top Spenders

Identify the the top 5 spenders in the game by total purchase value, then list (in a table):

SN
Purchase Count
Average Purchase Price
Total Purchase Value




Most Popular Items

Identify the 5 most popular items by purchase count, then list (in a table):

Item ID
Item Name
Purchase Count
Item Price
Total Purchase Value




Most Profitable Items

Identify the 5 most profitable items by total purchase value, then list (in a table):

Item ID
Item Name
Purchase Count
Item Price
Total Purchase Value



As final considerations:

You must use the Pandas Library and the Jupyter Notebook.
You must submit a link to your Github/Git Lab repo that contains your Jupyter Notebook.
You must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
See Example Solution for a reference on expected format.

Hints and Considerations


This is a challenging activity for a number of reasons. For one, the activity will require you to analyze thousands of records. Hacking through the data to look for obvious trends in Excel is just not a feasible option. The size of the data may seem daunting, but pandas will allow you to efficiently parse through it.


Second, this activity will also challenge you by requiring you to learn on your feet. Don't fool yourself into thinking: "I need to study pandas more closely before diving in." Get the basic gist of the library and then immediately get to work. When facing a daunting task, it's easy to think: "I'm just not ready to tackle it yet." But that's the surest way to never succeed. Learning to program requires one to constantly tinker, experiment, and learn on the fly. You are doing exactly the right thing, if you find yourself constantly practicing Google-Fu and diving into documentation. There is just no way (or reason) to try and memorize it all. Online references are available for you to use when you need them. So use them!


Begin your work, answering the basic questions: "How do I import the data?" "How do I convert the data into a DataFrame?" "How do I build the first table?" Don't get intimidated by the number of asks. Many of them are repetitive in nature with just a few tweaks. Be persistent and creative!


Expect these exercises to take time! Don't get discouraged if you find yourself spending  hours initially with little progress. Force yourself to deal with the discomfort of not knowing and forge ahead. Consider these hours an investment in your future!


As always, feel encouraged to work in groups and get help from your TAs and Instructor. Just remember, true success comes from mastery and not a completed homework assignment. So challenge yourself to truly succeed!


Ensure your repository has regular commits (i.e. 20+ commits) and a thorough README.md file
